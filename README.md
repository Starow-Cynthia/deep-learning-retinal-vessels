# 🧠 Deep Learning for Retinal Vessel Segmentation (MATLAB)

This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of **retinal blood vessel segmentation** using matched filtering, Gaussian derivatives, and post-processing techniques.  
It is designed for research and educational purposes in the field of medical image analysis.

Retinal vessel segmentation is a crucial step in diagnosing and monitoring diseases such as **diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and hypertension**.  
This project provides MATLAB scripts for preprocessing, segmentation, visualization, and performance evaluation.
